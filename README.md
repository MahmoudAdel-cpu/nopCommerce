# nopCommerce Automation with Playwright and Java

## Project Description

This project focuses on automating the testing of nopCommerce, an open-source e-commerce platform, using Playwright and Java. The framework incorporates Allure reporting to provide detailed and visually appealing test reports. Additionally, it utilizes Trace Viewer for in-depth analysis of test execution performance and diagnostics. By combining the power of Playwright, Java, Allure, and Trace Viewer, this project offers a comprehensive solution for testing nopCommerce across various scenarios with detailed performance insights.

### Why Automation with Allure Reporting and Trace Viewer?

Automation allows us to efficiently validate the functionality of nopCommerce with repeatable test scenarios. The integration of Allure reporting enhances the testing process by providing detailed steps, rich visuals, and historical test data. In parallel, Trace Viewer further complements the framework by offering:

- **Performance Analysis:** Trace Viewer captures performance data during test execution, allowing us to analyze and optimize test performance.

- **Diagnostics and Profiling:** Trace Viewer provides valuable insights into the test's behavior, resource usage, and bottlenecks, aiding in diagnostics and profiling.

- **Method-level Analysis:** Trace Viewer allows us to drill down into individual test methods, helping us identify performance issues at a granular level.

### Key Features

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Utilize Playwright's support for multiple browsers to test nopCommerce on various environments.

2. **Page Object Model (POM) Design:** Implement a structured POM design to improve code organization and maintainability.

3. **Test Data Management:** Use data-driven testing techniques to handle test data effectively, allowing the same test to be executed with different datasets.

4. **Allure Reporting:** Integrate Allure into the test framework to generate comprehensive and informative test reports.

5. **Trace Viewer Integration:** Capture and analyze performance data using Trace Viewer during test execution.

6. **Test Parallelization:** Enable test parallelization to reduce execution time and increase test suite efficiency.
